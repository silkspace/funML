Tweet,A Quantum theory of Gravity needs at least three unique attributes;," one of them is missing, which makes it impossible to construct.

In this small essay, I'm explaining why it's impossible. The theory of quantum gravity fails because a quantum theory cannot have more than one unique attribute. As a consequence, it's impossible to construct a self-consistent quantum theory of gravity. It's true for any conceivable quantum theory, and it's true even for a vacuum quantum theory, which is an extension of the theory of quantum mechanics beyond the particle and the wave duality. Vacuum quantum theory includes matter particles, spacetime geometry, and gravitational field.",2021-10-27 16:40:47.065174

Dan tried to find shelter as he walked in the dark. The sky had darkened and ominous clouds hovered in the high stars of the sky. The ground had turned to mud. It felt as though he was walking through a foot of water as he heard the wind stir the trees with a steady thumping that told of the impending storm. Thunder clapped and grew louder as he entered the rough and narrow path. He could see the bodies of fallen trees lying across the path. Dan stepped over a log that cracked under his foot. Pain shot through his foot. It felt as",2021-10-27 16:41:23.296802

CHAPTER 14

The Ring of Henge

Preston searched for the street lanterns of her father's car but instead found the silhouette of the stranger standing by the storefront. He would take his leave in the shadows and find himself a way to get home. It wouldn't be the first time he'd ended up here. At some point he would find his way home. For now, he would bide his time.

""So, this is what you do,"" the man said in a whisper. ""What kind of job is this?"" He took a step closer, but if he expected Preston to run or even to cry out, he was sorely mistaken.

""I need you to hold something for me,"" she said.

""How do I know you're even real?""

Preston took another step toward him. ""My name is Preston."" She paused and turned to face him. ""How do you know that's not some girl I have this coming from?""

""Because,"" he said. ""You don't smell like her."" He paused. ""You're a young lady. You shouldn't be out here in the dark.""

Preston stood for another moment, but there was no reply. She took a step back, shutting the stranger out of the backlight of the single car's lantern. The smell of him overpowered her. She staggered to the side of the road, lost and numb.

It was an hour or so later before Preston found the car. She looked at the half",2021-10-27 16:47:02.837038
